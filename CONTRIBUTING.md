## Key Concepts

When contributing, please keep these core concepts in mind:

* **Consciousness Levels**: The 7-level system is fundamental to the NFT generation
* **Sacred Geometry**: Geometric forms represent different states of consciousness
* **Privacy First**: All data should remain local until blockchain integration
* **User Experience**: The journaling experience should feel natural and unobtrusive
